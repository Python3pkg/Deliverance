Setting up Deliverance
======================

The whole idea of Deliverance is that it *shouldn't* be a system.
It's just a thin approach that leverages some serious work being done
by others.  In this case, Deliverance gets most of its value from:

  o Apache.  Don't fight it, love it!  Yeh, baby!

  o mod_python for both handlers and filters.

  o lxml and thus libxml2/libxslt.  This is 90% of the value
  proposition.

mod_python
----------

1) Grab mod_python.

2) Make sure you can do this:

  http://www.modpython.org/live/current/doc-html/inst-testing.html

3) Make sure Apache can read/write to the Deliverance examples directory.


lxml
-----

1) Get 0.6 or later of lxml:

  http://codespeak.net/lxml

2) Make sure you can run some of the tests.

3) Make sure you install it using the same Python used in mod_python.
   To confirm, put:

  import lxml.etree

...in the mptest.py module used in the mod_python Testing example.


Deliverance
-----------

1) Put a line like this:

   Include /Users/paul/projects/deliverance/examples/plonenet/etc/plonenet.conf

...in your Apache http.conf file.

2) Edit that plonenet.conf file:

  a. Change the Alias and Location lines to something meaningful.

  b. Makes sure the LoadModule points at the right mod_python.

  c. Fix the PythonPath line.

3) Restart Apache.

4) Go to the URL you put for the Location in the conf file and add
   "/echo123" on the URL.

You should see the sample file (content/echo123.xml) with the plonenet
theme.  If not, check the Apache error log for details.  Possibly the
web page will return a useful error message.
