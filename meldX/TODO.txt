To Do Items
-----------

  - Instead of a bunch of global variables, make it more library-like
    (I suck at designing things like that)

  - After the xsl:value-of is put in, run another xslt to post-process
    the theme

  - Have the type="" instruct mode="", moving this out of the Python
    code (not sure if this is worth it)

  - Figure out why the silly xmlns declaration wind up on the HTML
    element in the final output

  - Track down why CSS @import in a comment doesn't work when viewing
    the contentdoc.xml directly in a browser (and using the associated
    XSLT)
