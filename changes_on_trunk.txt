This document is a changelog "since the last release on PyPI"

 * FileRuleGetter now reloads the rules file on every request if it's initialized with always_reload=True
   In the Paste Deploy .ini file, setting debug=true will accomplish this

 * If the content document declares an XHTML doctype, then the output will be valid XML. 

 * If the content document declares any doctype, that doctype will be preserved in the output.
   Otherwise, the theme's doctype will be used if present. If neither document has a doctype,
   the default is HTML 4.0 Transitional.

 * rule_uri can now be a file:// URI

And .. some other stuff? I need to look this up and remember.
