 * Added a response-status matcher, for matching against the status code of the response.
   Use like <match response-status="404" class="notfounds" /> (esanchez)

 * Added a ReverseMatcher, which allows you to prefix a match statement with not: to reverse
   the result.  Use like <match path="not:/bad-path" /> (esanchez)

 * Added a boolean collapse-sources attribute on TransformActions
   (append, prepend, replace) which can signal that elements moved
   from the content to the theme should be "fully collapsed" into the
   theme immediately, allowing subsequent actions to act on those
   elements within the theme. (ejucovy)
